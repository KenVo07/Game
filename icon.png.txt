# Placeholder for icon.png
# 
# This file is a placeholder. In a real Godot project, you would have:
# - icon.png (64x64 or 128x128 PNG image)
# 
# For now, you can:
# 1. Create a simple dark purple/black icon with a moon or cultivation symbol
# 2. Use any 64x64 PNG as a temporary icon
# 3. Godot will use its default icon if this file is missing
#
# Suggested icon design:
# - Dark background (deep purple or black)
# - Silver/white crescent moon
# - Stylized qi/energy swirls
# - Minimalist cultivation symbol
