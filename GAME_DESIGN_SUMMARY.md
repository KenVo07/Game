# Simulation of the Eternal Path - Villain Edition
## Game Design Summary

### Core Concept

A dark-fantasy cultivation game that combines:
- **Twin-stick 2D combat** (Soul Knight style)
- **Text-based simulation system** (Villain Simulator)
- **Causal narrative engine** (choices permanently affect the world)
- **Cultivation progression** (immortal realms and powers)

### The Villain Simulator

The game's unique mechanic: a mysterious artifact that simulates possible futures.

**When activated:**
1. Rolls a random ability (White to Gold rarity)
2. Simulates your character's future actions
3. Shows how you might die (or succeed)
4. Reveals insights about the world
5. Offers rewards based on simulation

**The Twist:** Each simulation takes a toll on your faith in reality. Use it too much, and the boundary between simulation and reality blurs...

### Causal Narrative System

Unlike games with branching paths, this game has ONE timeline that reacts to everything you do.

**Key Features:**
- No "save scumming" - choices are permanent
- NPCs remember what you did
- World state changes based on karma
- Past actions unlock/lock future paths
- Consequences can come much later

**Example Chain:**
```
Destroy Sacred Talisman 
  → Sect becomes hostile
    → Elder warns you
      → Ignore warning
        → Sect raid attack
          → Death in simulation
            → Learn Elder's weakness
              → Ally with rival sect
                → Empire weakens permanently
```

### Cultivation System

**7 Realms of Power:**
1. Mortal - Beginning cultivator
2. Qi Condensation - Harness inner energy
3. Foundation Establishment - Solid cultivation base
4. Core Formation - Condense qi into core
5. Nascent Soul - Soul leaves body
6. Saint - Transcend mortality
7. True Immortal - Eternal existence

**3 Types of Sutras:**
1. **Heart Sutras**: Define your cultivation path

### Ability System

### Karma and Destiny

Your actions shape your fate:

- +30 to +69: Virtuous
- -29 to +29: Morally Gray
